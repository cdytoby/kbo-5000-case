# KBO-5000 Case

## 3D Printed Pieces

The STL files for the top shell and mid layer are intended for use with the 1.6mm thick FR4 plates from Keebio. If you have 1.5mm plates made elsewhere (like stainless steel, brass, etc.), those will work as well.

To assemble the full case with the prints, you will need 18mm M2 screws that will be inserted from the bottom case, by going through the bottom plate, then mid layer, then switch plate, and then finally the top shell. Since you are threading directly into the 3D print without threaded inserts, do note that there may be a limited number of times you can screw/unscrew the top shell.

## TODO List:

- More top shell variations
    - Left with blockers
    - Right with blockers
- Plate file DXFs
- Bottom wedge files to prop boards at various angles
