# KBO-5000 Case

## 3D Printed Pieces

The STL files for the top shell and mid layer are intended for use with the 1.6mm thick FR4 plates from Keebio. If you have 1.5mm plates made elsewhere (like stainless steel, brass, etc.), those will work as well.

## Things required for assembly

- Some 18mm M2 screws
- Some M2 inserted threads

The holes for inserted threads are 3.3mm diameter.
